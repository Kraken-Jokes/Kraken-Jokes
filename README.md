- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kraken-Jokes
- 👀 I’m interested in keyboards, input devices, lights, guitar, PCB's, soldering, and aesthetic design. To a point I guess. Function > form always.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get firmware to compile the FIRST FREAKING TIME I RUN IT
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ZMK and Via. I know I've seen some call it 'simple' but I either am not trying hard enough to learn or it makes no logical sense to me. If you do either ZMK or Via and are interested in writing that, I'd love to converse with  you
- 📫 How to reach me: Facebook probably. Insta @moorekeyboards as well
